- **Design:** Should resemble the design presented in Chapter 4, Project 3 of our textbook. The page should accurately implement a straightforward design while accommodating different browsers and devices.
- **Styling:** Main page style guidelines should extend to additional pages, ensuring a consistent look across the site. Use the same headers, fonts, and color schemes to maintain design coherence.

### CSS and Styling:
- **CSS References:** If online CSS snippets are used, credit must be given by referencing the original URLs in the CSS file comments.
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Usage of third-party CSS libraries is prohibited.

### Content and Functionality:
- **Buttons and Links:** Styled buttons or links should be added to the cards on the home page, directing users to corresponding pages. Content for these elements is available in the provided `data.txt` file.
- **Header and Footer:** All pages should include a consistent header with hover-style links and a footer with copyright statement and dummy links to additional information pages.

### Individual Pages:
- **Travel Image Pages:** Create three separate pages for different travel images, sharing the same CSS file. These pages should display specific information from `data.txt`, with image files named according to the format `<id>-large.jpg`.

### Map Integration:
